A - Write an SQL query to find the names of customers and their associated orders. Assume you have two tables: Customers and Orders. Customers has columns CustomerID and CustomerName, and Orders has columns OrderID, CustomerID, and OrderDate.

SELECT
    Customers.CustomerName,
    Orders.OrderID,
    Orders.OrderDate
FROM
    Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
    ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

B - Write an SQL query to list all customers and any orders they may have. Include customers who do not have any orders. Use the same Customers and Orders tables.

SELECT
    Customersu.CustomerName,
    Orders.OrderID,
    Orders.OrderDate
FROM
    Customersu
LEFT JOIN Orders
    ON Customersu.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
